            The founder of this protocol is Timothy John Berners-Lee. Timothy John Berners-Lee is a
            famous British scientist, inventor of the World Wide Web, and technologies such as URI,
            URL, HTTP, HTML. I think this man is really cool. The HTTP protocol is the basis of the
            World Wide Web we use it when viewing pages in a browser.

          <h3>Versions Protocol HTTP:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP 0.9 in 1992</li>
            <li>HTTP 1.0 in 1996</li>
            <li>HTTP 1.1 in 1999</li>
            <li>HTTP 2.0 in 2015</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            There are several versions of this protocol. The first experimental version was called
            --HTTP zero point nine (0.9) was developed in nineteen ninety-two years (1992). The very
            first official version --HTTP one (1) was adopted as standard in nineteen ninety-six
            years (1996) And very soon the extended protocol version was adopted --HTTP one point
            one (1.1) in nineteen ninety-nine years (1999) this version is still used In two
            thousand and fifteen (2015), a new version of the protocol appeared. -- HTTP two (2) now
            this version is only being commissioned and does not support all browsers. All data on
            the Internet is transmitted via this protocol. And is a way to communicate between the
            client and the server.

            If we want to make a request from the client to the server, then we need to say in some
            way what we need. It is also necessary to transfer additional information to the server.
            For example, we want to go to YouTube.com. In this case, we need to pass a method for
            how I make this request, this is a Get method, then the version of the protocol that I
            use this request is transmitted. Then I have to say where I am addressing on this server
            in this case YouTube.com.

          <h3>Methods HTTP</h3>
          <ul style="list-style:none">
            <li><span style="color:aqua">GET</span> - the transfer request of the web page</li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">POST</span> - data transfer to web server</li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">HEAD</span> - requests only the page title</li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">PUT</span> - the room page to your web server</li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">DELETE</span> - deleting a page from a web server</li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">TRACE</span> - helps to track page changes</li>
            <li>
              <span style="color:aqua">OPTIONS</span> - helps to know what methods are supported
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="color:aqua">CONNECT</span> - allows you to connect to the web server via
              Proxy
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Most popular methods are: Method GET – is request to send a web page, and the POST
            method - transfer data to a web server for processing (for example, when we write
            comments to videos on YouTube) Further rarely used methods: method HEAD - requests only
            the page header (this is like the GET method only without the message body), method PUT
            - placing the page on a web server, DELETE - delete a page from the web server, method
            TRACE - helps to track changes to the page, namely what changes it makes, OPTIONS -
            helps to find out which methods are supported for a specific resource on a web server,
            CONNECT - allows you to connect to the web server through a proxy.

            In response, the server sends information where the protocol field is indicated in the
            first field, which is used, then a three-digit number indicating the request processing
            status. There are the following statuses:

            <li>
              <span style="color:aqua">2XX</span> - successful implementation (for example 200 OK)
            </li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">3XX</span> - redirect</li>
            <li>
              <span style="color:aqua">4XX</span> - error on the client side(for example 404 - page
              not found)
            </li>
            <li><span style="color:aqua">5XX</span> - server error</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            1xx - statuses starting with one are used to send informational messages 2xx - statuses
            that begin with the number two, indicate that the request was completed successfully 3xx
            - statuses that start with the number three speak of page redirection 4xx - statuses
            that start with the number four indicate that the error was made on the client side 5xx
            - statuses that start at number five indicate an error on the server side Several
            headers follow, such as the type of web page being transmitted, the length of the page,
            and the code of the web page. After the transfer of the web page, the connection is
            broken.

            Now the modern WEB is much more complicated. Instead of static web pages that are stored
            on disk server, can be used by programs that generate dynamic Web pages

            In doing so, they can connect to databases or other servers to obtain the necessary
            data. Modern web pages are very complex; they include a large number of additional
            elements such as images, data from other web servers or programs that run on the client.
            In addition, it is often necessary to monitor the user’s work status, for example, if
            you work with online store sites, for example, put some goods in the cart, and they
            should remain there even if the user navigates to other pages on this site. HTTP
            includes features for implementing these functions.
